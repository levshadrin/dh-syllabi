This repository contains data and code for my HSE DH Master's thesis defense presentation, carried out on June 23, 2023.

## Thesis
The thesis explores several natural language processing methods and tools for their potential application to analyzing Digital Humanities education programs in Russia. 

The analyzed texts comprise descriptions collected from the educational program webpages, as well as publicly available course syllabi. 

The thesis features an overview of previous research on similar topics, and highlights the key points of debates regarding the disciplinary identity of Digital Humanities as a research field, concluding with suggested entry points for further research on the structure of DH educational programs in Russia.
